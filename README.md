# MishkaBlog
website made for my puppy
this was another practice run to work alongside my bootcamp project and incorporate the things i was learning. 
this site uses node modules, javascript, and bootstrap. still a rough sketch, i will go back to this site and incorporate more dynamic components with react.
WIP
